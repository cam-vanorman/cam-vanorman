I currently work at [Northeastern University](https://github.com/efellemedia) as a web developer. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanormandesign/ "LinkedIn of Cameron Van Orman"), view [my recent work](https://vanorman.co/ "Website Portfolio of Cameron Van Orman"), or chat securely with me on [KeyBase](https://keybase.io/cameronv). Recently I participated in a [tech talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHx_v5ZtZrg) with other web agencies to discuss running an agency or web dev shop on DigitalOcean.
