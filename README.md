I am the founder of [Blue Beetle Technology](https://bluebeetletech.com/), a remote web and application development consultancy, and I also work remotely as a Lead Web Developer, IT Services, at Northeastern University. I thrive in comfortable and inspiring spaces—a forest on a mountain—where being away from traditional office settings fuels my creativity and productivity.
